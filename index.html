    <H1>How to get over 1000 subscribers in you tube</H1>
    <p>If you are new to youtube, follow the following steps to get subscribers very easily with less efforts</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Make sure that you use key words in yout tittle</li>
        <p>This means if you are for example making videos about relaxing videos; the key word here is relax and it should appear as the first or second word in your tittle.</p>

        <li>The second this that I advise is about the thumbnail</li>
        <p>if you want your video to look attractive to viewers you need to make a thumbnail which is very attractive and use bright colors in your thumbnail wording, this ensures that it is very visible when someone opens youtube</p>

        <li>Try to the use of tags</li>
        <p>Through use of tags you can get suggestion on your video through you tube algorithms.It is also good to note that tags are not straight ticket to get views and subscriptions; one should focus on content and keys words as well</p>

        <li>Be consistent in creating content</li>
        <p>If you need to do well in You tube try and be consistent in your work.This shows your followers that you are commited to your work and they will even share your content with other people and this will grow your base</p>

        <li>Make good quality content</li>
        <p>The quality of work maters a lot; if you make high quality videos chances are that more people will like your work, and when people like your work it is automatic that they will be your folloers and even refer your work to other people</p>

        <li>Use premieres</li>
        <p>You tube premieres is a ways of making your video available at certain time.This notifies your folloers on the time and they will be ready waiting for the release of videos to watch.This is a way of getting more watch hours.</p>

        <li>You can use google ads</li>
        <p>This one needs some money to use.It is a kind of advertisement which is run by google.It enables you to get views quickly and directs people to your site.The key thing to note here is this service is not free it is paid for</p>

    </ol>
